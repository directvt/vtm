# Text-based Desktop Environment

## Desktop Objects and Built-in Applications

 Type      | Object                         | Description
-----------|--------------------------------|----------------------
`teletype` | `Teletype Console`             | A solid rectangular truecolor text canvas depicting a freely scrollable buffer of the text runs generated by an xterm-compatible parser from the standard output of an attached CUI application. It can be a very heavy object due to maintaining a scrollback buffer of arbitrary length. Not used directly in the desktop process's address space.
`terminal` | `Terminal Console`             | A derivative of `Teletype Console` with additional UI controls.
`dtvt`     | `DirectVT Gateway`             | A lightweight truecolor text canvas depicting content received from an external dtvt-aware process.
`vtty`     | `Teletype Console dtvt‑bridge` | A `DirectVT Gateway` hosting an external standalone `Teletype Console` process. It is designed to run a heavy `Teletype Console` object in the external process's address space to optimize desktop resource consumption.
`term`     | `Terminal Console dtvt‑bridge` | A `DirectVT Gateway` hosting an external standalone `Terminal Console` process. It is designed to run a heavy `Terminal Console` object in the external process's address space to optimize desktop resource consumption.
`dtty`     | `DirectVT Gateway with TTY`    | A derivative of `DirectVT Gateway` stacked with additional limited `Teletype Console` as a controlling terminal. It is used for CUI applications that redirect DirectVT traffic to standard output and require user input via platform's TTY. Depending on activity the corresponding console became active for the user.
`tile`     | `Tiling Window Manager`        | A window container with an organization of the hosting window area into mutually non-overlapping panes for nested windows.
`site`     | `Desktop Region Marker`        | A transparent resizable frame for marking the specific desktop region for quick navigation across the borderless workspace.

## Terminal and Teletype Console

### Features

- Non-wrapped text output with horizontal scrolling.
- Terminal control using Lua scripts via APC.
- Special (Exclusive) keyboard mode for terminal window to transfer all keyboard data to the terminal as is.
- Configurable scrollback buffer size (100k lines by default, limited by `max_int32` and system RAM).
- Independent text-only and color-only output.
- Search for text in the scrollback buffer.
- Linear and rectangular text selection for copying and searching.
- True color with alpha transparency.
- Full [VT2D](character_geometry.md) support.
- TUI Shadows as SGR attribute.
- Support for several formats of copying the selected text:
  - Plain text
  - RTF
  - HTML
  - ANSI/VT
  - Protected (Windows platform only: `ExcludeClipboardContentFromMonitorProcessing`, `CanIncludeInClipboardHistory`, `CanUploadToCloudClipboard`)
- In-process Windows Console API Server of our implementation:
  - Win32 Console API support without Windows Console Host (conhost.exe) dependency.
  - Fullduplex passthrough VT input/output.
  - Support for OEM/National, UTF-8 and UTF-16 encodings.
  - Enforced ENABLE_WINDOW_INPUT mode.  
    Note: In fact it is a viewport resize event reporting. Viewport dimensions is always equal to the classic win32 console buffer dimensions.
  - Enforced ENABLE_PROCESSED_OUTPUT and ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING modes.
  - Disabled ENABLE_QUICK_EDIT_MODE mode.
  - Per process (not per process name) Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe) input history, aka "Line input" or "Cooked read".
  - Floating point (pixel-wise) mouse reporting.
- Stdin/stdout logging.

### True color with alpha transparency

The built-in terminal has support for transparent color overlays as follows:

- Store an alpha channel for background and foreground colors of each scrollback cell.
- Inherit the foreground alpha for underline colors.
- Handle the terminal window rendering by:
  - Blending the semi-transparent background color of the scrollback rows with the global background color (set by OSC 11).
  - Blending the semi-transparent foreground (and underline) color of the scrollback rows with the final background color calculated in the previous step.

The alpha transparency can be set from 0 to 255 (in the RGBA sense) for both the text background and the foreground using the SGR attributes `48:2` and `38:2`:

  - `ESC` `[` `48` `:` `2` `:` [ `:` ] `red` `:` `green` `:` `blue` [ `:alpha` ] `m`
  - `ESC` `[` `38` `:` `2` `:` [ `:` ] `red` `:` `green` `:` `blue` [ `:alpha` ] `m`

An example of using color brushes that are independent of the global background:

```bash
printf "
\e[48:2::0:0:0:0m \e[35b\n  \e[48:2::0:0:255:128m Some Text Fragment \e[48:2::0:0:0:0m  
\e[48:2::0:0:0:0m \e[35b\n  \e[48:2::0:255:0:128m Some Text Fragment \e[48:2::0:0:0:0m  
\e[48:2::0:0:0:0m \e[35b\n  \e[48:2::255:0:0:128m Some Text Fragment \e[48:2::0:0:0:0m  
\e[48:2::0:0:0:0m \e[35b\n  \e[48:2::0:255:255:128m Some Text Fragment \e[48:2::0:0:0:0m  
\e[48:2::0:0:0:0m \e[35b\n  \e[48:2::255:255:0:128m Some Text Fragment \e[48:2::0:0:0:0m  
\e[48:2::0:0:0:0m \e[35b\n  \e[48:2::255:0:255:128m Some Text Fragment \e[48:2::0:0:0:0m  
 \e[36b\n\e[m"

```

### Independent text-only and color-only output

#### Text-only output

Outputting plain text over other colored text while preserving all SGR attributes allows changing the text inside cells without having to re-specify the color and other SGR attributes for the output string (there may be a large number of attributes, and the one who prints may not even support it). This significantly simplifies and speeds up the output of intensively updated colored text blocks. This is achieved by using the so-called "transparent" color. The "transparent" color could be enabled by setting the following values for the background color: **red=255, green=255, blue=255, alpha=0**.

For example, replacing the string `Hello` with `World` inside a colored text line:
```bash
printf "\e[44;31m Hello \e[m Mono text\r\e[48:2::255:255:255:0m World\e[m\n"
```

#### Color-only output

Printing SGR attributes without text over existing content allows to colorize existing on-screen blocks without having to re-print the text itself. Keeping the existing text on-screen is achieved by using the required number of null characters as the output string. When outputting a null character, the vtm terminal keeps the current character in the cell, updating only the SGR attributes.

For example, color only the word ` Hello ` inside a monochrome string:
```bash
printf " Hello Test\r\e[44;31m\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\e[m\n"
```

### Terminal control using Lua scripts via APC

The built-in terminal is capable of executing Lua scripts received via APC (Application Program Command) vt-sequences. The format of the vt-sequence is as follows:

```
ESC _ lua: <script body> ST
```
or
```
ESC _ lua:FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF: <script body> ST
```
where:
- `ESC_`: APC vt-sequence prefix.
- `lua:`: case-insensitive APC payload marker.
- `<script body>`: Lua script body.
- `ST`: `ESC``\` or `BEL` - APC sequence terminator.
- `FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF:`: 16-hexadecimal-digit interactive session token ending with a colon. This token can be obtained using the following APC request: `\e_lua:terminal.RequestInteractiveSessionToken()\a` - The terminal will respond with an APC sequence containing the 16 digits of the required interactive token: `\e_event=session;token=FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\e\\`.

Note: Without specifying an interactive session token, calls to functions related to interactive interaction (moving/sizing windows, mouse, keyboard, focus, etc.) will be silently ignored.

Usage examples:

Note: The global variable `terminal` (in the Lua namespace) is an alias for `vtm.terminal`.

- `bash`:
  ```
  # Print the current scrollback buffer limits
  printf "\e_lua: local n,m,q=terminal.ScrollbackSize(); terminal.PrintLn('size=', n, ' growstep=', m, ' maxsize=', q)\e\\"

  # Set the scrollback buffer limit to 10K lines
  printf "\e_lua: terminal.ScrollbackSize(10000)\a"

  # Maximize the terminal window
  ## 1. Get a session token:
  printf "\e_lua:terminal.RequestInteractiveSessionToken()\a"
  ## 2. Use the received token when requesting to maximize the window:
  printf "\e_lua:0000000000000000: vtm.applet.Maximize()\e\\"
  ```

A complete list of available script functions can be found in [settings.md](settings.md#event-sources).

Note: The terminal parser may incorrectly detect the boundaries of a control sequence if the script body contains an explicit ESC character. In such cases, it is necessary to use character combinations that represent ESC implicitly, such as `\e`, `\u{1b}`, `\x1b`.

Example in bash:
```bash
printf "\e_lua: terminal.PrintLn('\\e[44mHello!\\e[m')\a"
printf "\e_lua: terminal.PrintLn('\\\u{1b}[44mHello!\\\u{1b}[m')\a"
printf "\e_lua: terminal.PrintLn('\\x1b[44mHello!\\x1b[m')\a"
```

### Special keyboard mode for terminal window to transfer all keyboard input to the terminal as is

The special (visible in the UI as Exclusive) terminal window mode allows all keyboard input to be passed through directly to the terminal, suppressing the existing UI keyboard bindings. This makes it possible for the terminal application to reuse any key combinations assigned to the terminal window, the vtm desktop, or another external UI object. The list of default key bindings is available in [`user-interface.md`](user-interface.md).

### Private control sequences

Note: Since `CSI p` sequences are used by other terminals, all private vt-sequences must be replaced with alternative ones using Lua scripting via APC.

APC sequence                                               | Deprecated sequence                | Description

### TUI Shadows as SGR attribute

The built-in terminal supports for in-cell UI shadows, specified using a colon-separated subparameter of the SGR 2 (faint) attribute.

- `ESC [ 2 :` n `m`  
  where n=0-255 is a bit field to specify shadows inside the cell.

The subparameter is a decimal integer from 0 to 255, the value of which corresponds to the state of the bits representing cells around the cell: In the center is the shaded cell, and around it are the shading cells.  The presence of shading cells corresponds to a bit value of 1, the absence - to a bit value of 0.

Every bit "drops the shadow" inside the "central" cell:
```
Shadow bits:  0  1  2
              3 >n< 4
              5  6  7
```

The bits are enumerated from the upper left corner row by row excluding the central shaded cell. Eight bits are used, hence the range of subparameter values 0-255 inclusive. This approach allows shadows to be combined with each other simply by performing a binary OR operation.

Shadows persist as an SGR attribute and are visible in GUI mode:

#### Examples

- Shadows around the single cell:
  ```
   0  0  0   0  0  0   0  0  0
   0 >1< 0   0 >2< 0   0 >4< 0
   0  0  1   0  1  0   1  0  0
           ┌─────────┐        
   0  0  0 │         │ 0  0  0
   0 >8< 1 │  1x1    │ 1 >16<0
   0  0  0 │  1 cell │ 0  0  0
           └─────────┘        
   0  0  1   0  1  0   1  0  0
   0 >32<0   0 >64<0   0>128<0
   0  0  0   0  0  0   0  0  0
    ```
- Shadows (outer and inner) around the 3x1 text block (pwsh)

### Floating point (pixel-wise) mouse reporting

On Windows, when using the Win32 Console API, vtm reports mouse events with fractional mouse coordinates. Pixel-wise or fractional coordinates are 32-bit floating-point numbers that represent the position of the mouse cursor relative to the console's grid of text cells. Screen pixel coordinates can be calculated by multiplying the fractional coordinates by the cell size.
Fractional mouse coordinates are critical to UX. In particular, this directly relates to the sensitivity of scrollbars, where moving the mouse pointer even one pixel can cause content to scroll several lines.

Example:
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <windows.h>

static constexpr auto custom_type = 0b1000'0000'0000'0000;
static constexpr auto fp2d_mouse = 3;
struct fp2d_mouse_input : MENU_EVENT_RECORD // MENU_EVENT_RECORD structure extension.
{
    //DWORD EventType   = MENU_EVENT;
    //DWORD dwCommandId = custom_type | fp2d_mouse;
    float x; // Floating point mouse x coord.
    float y; // Floating point mouse y coord.
};
int main()
{
    auto inp = ::GetStdHandle(STD_INPUT_HANDLE);
    ::SetConsoleMode(inp, ENABLE_EXTENDED_FLAGS | ENABLE_MOUSE_INPUT);
    auto r = INPUT_RECORD{};
    auto count = DWORD{};
    auto x = std::numeric_limits<float>::quiet_NaN();
    auto y = std::numeric_limits<float>::quiet_NaN();
    auto mouse_out = false;
    std::cout << "Press any mouse button to exit\n";
    while (true)
    {
        ::ReadConsoleInputW(inp, &r, 1, &count);
        if (r.EventType == MENU_EVENT)
        {
            if (r.Event.MenuEvent.dwCommandId == (custom_type | fp2d_mouse)) // The floating point coordinates message always precedes the classic mouse report.
            {
                x = reinterpret_cast<fp2d_mouse_input*>(&r.Event.MenuEvent)->x;
                y = reinterpret_cast<fp2d_mouse_input*>(&r.Event.MenuEvent)->y;
                mouse_out = std::isnan(x); // NaN is a sign that the mouse has gone away or is disconnected.
                if (mouse_out) std::cout << "The mouse has left the window\n";
            }
        }
        else if (r.EventType == MOUSE_EVENT && !mouse_out)
        {
            if (r.Event.MouseEvent.dwButtonState) return 0;
            if (std::isnan(x)) // Classical behavior.
            {
                std::cout << "MOUSE_EVENT coord: " << r.Event.MouseEvent.dwMousePosition.X << "," << r.Event.MouseEvent.dwMousePosition.Y << "\n";
            }
            else // Floating point mouse coordinates.
            {
                std::cout << "MOUSE_EVENT coord: " << x << "," << y << "\n";
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Window menu

It is possible to create your own terminal window menu from scratch by configuring own menu items in the `<config/terminal/menu/>` subsection of the configuration file. See (`doc/settings.md#event-scripting`)[https://github.com/directvt/vtm/blob/master/doc/settings.md#event-scripting] for details.

Common syntax for window menu item declaration:

```xml
<config>
    <terminal>
        <menu>
            <item label="SomeLabelText">
                <script="Lua script body..." on="LeftClick"/>
                <tooltip>
                    " Tooltip text.      \n"
                    " Can be multi-line. "
                </tooltip>
            </item>
            ...
        </menu>
    </terminal>
</config>
```

## DirectVT Gateway

DirectVT Gateway is used to attach DirectVT-aware sources. It is mainly used to receive DirectVT traffic from an external dtvt-endpoint.

## DirectVT Gateway with TTY

DirectVT Gateway with TTY is used when there is a need for interactive interaction with the user through the controlling terminal. For example, this is required when connecting via SSH with keyboard-interactive authentication or requesting a private key passphrase.

In case of running in standalone mode this window object type is used automatically if the first command line argument begins with `ssh` keyword.

The following commands are identical:
```
vtm -r dtty ssh user@host vtm
```
```
vtm ssh user@host vtm
```

## Desktop Region Marker

The Desktop Region Marker is used to quickly navigate the desktop by left-clicking on an instance in the taskbar. The region title can be set using the clipboard text data by right-clicking once on the region frame (swap clipboard text with title text).

## Tiling Window Manager

Tiling Window Manager is a window container that organizes the workspace into mutually non-overlapping panes for nested windows.

### Features

- Supports Drag and Drop for panes (like tabs in a browser). Use any modifiers (`Ctrl` or `Alt`) while pane dragging to suppress this functionality.
- For convenient management of running applets, there is a parallel list of them on the right side of the Tile Manager window:
  - `LeftClick` -- To set exclusive focus for applet.
  - `Ctrl+LeftClick` -- To set/unset group focus.
  - `LeftDoubleClick` -- Maximize/Restore selected applet.
- It is configurable via settings (See configuration example in doc\settings.md`).

### Configuration example

```xml
